# Automated form-filler for questionnaires in the forced-choice format

Test script to generate random data of 600 bots. The aim was to compare the bot responses to real (human-generated) 
responses in order to disentangle human-generated careless from computer-generated bot responses. 

On each page a random item and rank order (block size of 3) is drawn. The time interval between the responses varies 
between .5 and 6 seconds.
